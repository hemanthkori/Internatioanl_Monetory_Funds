# International Monetary Funds Analysis

This project explores data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to understand patterns in global finance, including lending programs, member quotas, and macroeconomic indicators. The goal is to present complex economic information in an accessible, visually engaging format.

## Objectives

- Collect and consolidate publicly available IMF statistics on lending, quotas, and country-level economic metrics.
- Create clear visualizations to highlight geographic and temporal trends.
- Summarize key findings and insights in a narrative presentation.
- Demonstrate competency in data storytelling for economic and financial datasets.

## Data & Methodology

- **Sources:** IMF Data Portal (e.g., World Economic Outlook, Financial Data Query Tool) and supplementary reports.
- **Tools:** Data aggregated in spreadsheets; visualizations and commentary created in **Microsoft PowerPoint**.
- **Approach:** Descriptive analysis of country-level data, focusing on comparisons across regions and time periods.

## Key Insights

- IMF lending activity varies significantly by region, with emerging economies receiving the bulk of recent financing.
- Country quota shares are heavily skewed toward large economies, influencing voting power and access to resources.
- Macroeconomic indicators (GDP growth, inflation, fiscal balances) help contextualize IMF assistance and policy recommendations.

## Deliverables

- **Presentation:** [`IMF.pptx`](./IMF.pptx) – a slide deck containing charts, maps, and explanations of IMF datasets and insights.
- **Images:** Screenshots of key visuals (included in the repository) for quick reference.
- **Documentation:** `README.md` (this file) – a summary of the project scope, methodology, and findings.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Economic Data Analysis:** Sourcing and interpreting complex financial datasets from the IMF.
- **Visual Communication:** Designing impactful slides and graphics to explain economic concepts.
- **Research & Synthesis:** Combining quantitative data with qualitative context to tell a compelling story.
